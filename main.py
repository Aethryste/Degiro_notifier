# Richard Algra | exam-exercise | 'Degiro notifier'
"""
This script serves as the manager of both web_scraper.py and telegram_bot.py, I've chosen to separate the two and manage
them both through this script for two reasons. The first reason is to prevent runtime errors caused by web_scraper.py
and telegram_bot.py simultaneously trying to interact with DN_database.csv. The second reason is to have my project
properly organised and thereby 'readable' to classmates and teachers.

Regarding self-development I'd say the most notable things I've learned during this project are:
-I've used 'Selenium' web-scraping to both learn about the subject and because 'Degiro' doesn't have an official API.
-I've been introduced to the 'Pandas' library, which I needed for saving and interacting with the collected data.
-I've learned how to interact with a telegram bot to stay up to date when running bot scripts.
